            <h1>Self-Sufficient Clans</h1><br>
            To any dragonborn, the clan is m ore important than
            life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect
            to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each
            dragonborn’s conduct reflects on the honor of his or her
            clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in
            expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn know s his or her
            station and duties within the clan, and honor demands
            maintaining the bounds of that position.<br>

            war between good and evil (represented by Bahamut
            and Tiamat, respectively). Most dragonborn are good,

            <b>Breath</b> Weapon. You can use your action to exhale
            destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines
            the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.
            W hen you use your breath weapon, each creature in
            the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw,
            the type of which is determined by your draconic
            ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 +
            your Constitution m odifier + your proficiency bonus. A
            creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half
            as much damage on a successful one. The damage
            increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6
            at 16th level.
            After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it
            again until you complete a short or long rest.<br>
            <b>Damage Resistance.</b> You have resistance to the
            damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.<br>
            <b>Languages.</b> You can speak, read, and write Com m on
            and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the
            oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic.
            The language sounds harsh to m ost other creatures and
            includes num erous hard consonants and sibilants.<br>
