            <h1>Variety in All Things</h1><br>
            Humans are the m ost adaptable and ambitious people
            am ong the com m on races. They have widely varying
            tastes, morals, and custom s in the many different lands
            where they have settled. W hen they settle, though,
            they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and
            great kingdom s that can persist for long centuries. An
            individual human might have a relatively short life span,
            but a human nation or culture preserves traditions
            with origins far beyond the reach of any single human’s
            memory. They live fully in the present—making them
            well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the
            future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and
            as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and
            they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.<br>

            <h1>Human Traits</h1><br>
            It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but
            your human character has these traits.<br>
            <b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your ability scores each
            increase by 1.<br>
            <b>Age.</b> Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and
            live less than a century.<br>
            <b>Alignment.</b> Humans tend toward no
            particular alignment. The best and the worst are
            found am ong them.<br>
            <b>Size.</b> Humans vary widely in height and build, from
            barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your
            position in that range, your size is Medium.<br>
            <b>Speed.</b> Your base w alking speed is 30 feet.<br>
            <b>Languages.</b> You can speak, read, and write Com m on
            and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically
            learn the languages of other peoples they deal with,
            including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling
            their speech with w ords borrow ed from other tongues:
            Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish
            military phrases, and so on.<br>
            <hr>
            <h1>Variant Human Traits</h1><br>
            Your Dungeon Master might allow these variant traits, all of
            which replace the human’s Ability Score Increase trait.<br>
            <b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Two diffrent ability scores of your choice increase by 1<br>
            <b>Skills</b> You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice<br>
            <b>Feat</b> You gain one feat of your choice<br>
