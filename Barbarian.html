            <h1>Primal Instinct</h1>
            People of towns and cities take pride in how their
            civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if
            denying one’s ow n nature w as a mark o f superiority. To
            a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign
            of w eakness. The strong em brace their animal n atu rekeen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage.
            Barbarians are uncom fortable when hedged in by walls
            and crow ds. They thrive in the w ilds o f their homelands:
            the tundra, jungle, or grasslands w here their tribes
            live and hunt.<br>

        <h1>Primal Paths</h1><br>
        Rage burns in every barbarian’s heart, a furnace
that drives him or her toward greatness. Different
        barbarians attribute their rage to different sources,
however. For som e, it is an internal reservoir where
pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as
steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of
a totem animal.<br>
        <h1>Path of the Berserker</h1><br>
        For som e barbarians, rage is a means to an end-—that
end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path
of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter
the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle,
heedless of your own health or well-being.

you, it must succeed on a W isdom saving throw (DC

        <h1>Pathof the Totem Warrior</h1><br>
        The Path of the Totem W arrior is a spiritual journey, as
the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector,
and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you
with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your
barbarian rage.
Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be
kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for
an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit,
though exceptions exist.

        <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>SpirtSeeker</b></button>

world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when
you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the beast
sense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals,
as described in chapter 10.

totem spirit and gain its feature. You must m ake or
acquire a physical totem object- an amulet or similar
adornment—that incorporates fur or feathers, claws,
teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you
also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent
of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear
totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thickskinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn
bright yellow.
      Your totem animal might be an animal related to those
listed here but m ore appropriate to your homeland.
For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in
place o f an eagle.<br>
      <b>Bear.</b> W hile raging, you have resistance to all damage

      <b>Eagle.</b> W hile you're raging and aren’t wearing
heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on
opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the
Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit
of the eagle m akes you into a predator w ho can weave
through the fray with ease.<br>
      <b>Wolf,</b> W hile you're raging, your friends have
advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature
