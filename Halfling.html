            <h1>Kind and Curious</h1><br>
            Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They
            cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well
            as the com forts of hearth and home, harboring few
            dream s of gold or glory. Even adventurers am ong
            them usually venture into the w orld for reasons of
            community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They
            love discovering new things, even simple things, such
            as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing.
            <hr>
            <h1>Halfling Traits</h1><br>

            second century.<br>
            <b>Alignment.</b> M ost halflings are lawful good. As a rule,
            they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in
            pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are
            also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on
            the support of their com m unity and the com fort of
            their old ways.<br>
            <b>Size.</b> Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh

            halflings are loath to share it with others. They write
            very little, so they don’t have a rich body o f literature.
            Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Alm ost all

            Lightfoots are m ore prone to wanderlust than other
            halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take
            up a nom adic life. In the world of Greyhawk, these

            in the south.<br>
