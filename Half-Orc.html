            <h1>The Mark of Gruumsh</h1><br>
            The one-eyed god Gruumsh created the orc s, and even
            those orcs w ho turn away from his w orship can’t fully
            escape his influence. The sam e is true o f half-orcs,
            though their human blood m oderates the impact of their
            orcish heritage. Som e half-orcs hear the w hispers of
            Gruumsh in their dream s, calling them to unleash the
            rage that sim m ers within them. Others feel Gruum sh’s
            exultation w hen they join in m elee com bat—and either
            exult along with him or shiver with fear and loathing.
            Half-orcs are not evil by nature, but evil does lurk within
            them, whether they em brace it or rebel against it<br>

            <b>Alignment.</b> Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos
            from their orc parents and are not strongly inclined
            toward good. Half-orcs raised among ores and willing
            to live out their lives am ong them are usually evil.<br>

            no script of its own
            but is written in the
            Dwarvish script.<br>
