            <h1>Music and Magic</h1><br>
            In the worlds of DND, w ords and music are
not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with
pow er all their own. The bard is a master of song,
speech, and the m agic they contain. Bards say
that the multiverse w as spoken into existence, that the
w ords o f the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these
primordial W ords o f Creation still resound throughout
the cosm os. The m usic of bards is an attempt to snatch
and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their
spells and powers.<br>

<h1>S p e l l c a s t i n g</h1>
You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of
reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your
spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you
can tune to different situations. S ee chapter 10 for the
general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the
bard spell list.<br>
<h3>Cantrips</h3>
You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard
spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your
choice at higher levels, as show n in the Cantrips Known
colum n of the Bard table.<br>
            <h3>SpellSlots</h3><br>
The Bard table show s how many spell slots you have to
cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure
wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot
available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.<br>
<h3>Spells Knownof 1st Level and Higher</h3><br>
You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the
bard spell list.
The Spells Known colum n of the Bard table shows

these spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots, as show n on the table. For instance, when you
reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell
o f 1st or 2nd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you
can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace
it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also
must be of a level for which you have spell slots.<br>
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><br>
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard
spells. Your m agic com es from the heart and soul you

spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma
            modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard
spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.<br>
            <b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier<br>
            <b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier<br>
            <h3>Ritual Casting</h3><br>

spell has the ritual tag.<br>

To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose
one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you

Inspiration die, a d6.
Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll
the die and add the number rolled to one ability check,
attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can
wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the
Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM
says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic
Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have
only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.
You can use this feature a number of tim es equal
to your Charisma modifier (a minim um of once). You
regain any expended uses w hen you finish a long rest.
Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach

    <h1>Bard Colleges</h1><br>
    The way of a bard is gregarious. Bards seek each
other out to swap songs and stories, boast o f their
accom plishm ents, and share their knowledge. Bards
form loose associations, which they call colleges, to
facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions.<br>
    <h1>College of Lore</h1>
    Bards of the College o f Lore know som ething about
m ost things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources
as diverse as scholarly tom es and peasant tales.
W hether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate
com positions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts
to hold audiences spellbound. W hen the applause dies
down, the audience m em bers might find themselves
questioning everything they held to be true, from their
faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their
loyalty to the king.
The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty
and truth, not in fealty to a m onarch or following the
tenets of a deity. A noble w ho keeps such a bard as a
herald or advisor knows that the bard w ould rather be
honest than politic.
The college’s m em bers gather in libraries and
som etim es in actual colleges, com plete with classroom s
and dormitories, to share their lore with one another.
They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they
can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at selfimportant figures of authority.

  <p>A lso at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to
distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and

check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to
expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling
a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number
rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to use
this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before
the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability
      check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its
damage. The creature is immune if it can’t hear you or if
it’s immune to being charmed.
