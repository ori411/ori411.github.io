           <h1>The Cause of Righteousness</h1><br>
            A paladin sw ears to uphold justice and righteousness,
to stand with the good things of the world against the
encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil
wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various
aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are
bound by the oaths that grant them pow er to do their
sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to
gods of good, a paladin’s pow er com es as much from a
com m itm ent to justice itself as it does from a god.

                        <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Divine Sense</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like
a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly
m usic in your ears. As an action, you can open your
awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your
next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend,
or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total
cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of
any being w hose presence you sense, but not its identity
(the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance).
Within the sam e radius, you also detect the presence
o f any place or object that has been consecrated or
desecrated, as with the hallow spell.
You can use this feature a num ber of times equal to
1 + your Charisma modifier. W hen you finish a long rest,
you regain all expended uses.

    </p>
</div>
                  <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Lay on Hands</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool
o f healing pow er that replenishes when you take a long
rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of
hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.
As an action, you can touch a creature and draw
pow er from the pool to restore a num ber of hit points
to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining
in your pool.
Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your
pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or
neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple
diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single
use o f Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately
for each one.
This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.
    </p>
</div>

                  <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Fighting Style</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your
specialty. C hoose one of the follow ing options. You can’t
take a Fighting Style option m ore than once, even if you
later get to choose again.<br>
      <b>D e f e n s e</b>
W hile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.<br>
<b>D u e l i n g</b>
W hen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and
no other w eapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls
with that weapon.<br>
<b>G r e a t W e a p o n F i g h t i n g</b>
W hen you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you
make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with
two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new
roll. The w eapon must have the two-handed or versatile
property for you to gain this benefit.<br>
<b>P r o t e c t i o n</b>
W hen a creature you can see attacks a target other
than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your
reaction to im pose disadvantage on the attack roll.
You must be wielding a shield.
    </p>
</div>

                  <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Spellcasting</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine
m agic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as
a cleric does. S ee chapter 10 for the general rules of
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.<br>
<h3>P r e p a r i n g a n d C a s t i n g S p e l l s</h3><br>
The Paladin table show s how many spell slots you have
to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of
1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s
level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when
you finish a long rest.
You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available
for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list.
W hen you do so, ch oose a num ber of paladin spells
equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin
level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells
must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have
four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a
Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include
four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you
prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast
it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell
doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.
You can change your list of prepared spells when you
finish a long rest. Preparing a new list o f paladin spells
requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1
minute per spell level for each spell on your list.<BR>
    <H3>Spellcasting Ability</H3><br>
    Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin
spells, since their pow er derives from the strength of
    your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you
use your Charisma m odifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making
an attack roll with one.<br>
    <b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier<br>
    <b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier<br>
    <h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3><br>
    You can use a holy symbol as a
spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.

        <h1>SacredO aths</h1><br>
        B ecom ing a paladin involves taking vows that com m it
the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active
path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken
when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination
of all the paladin’s training. S om e characters with this
class don’t consider themselves true paladins until
they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For
others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality,
an official stamp on what has always been true in the
paladin’s heart.

    <br>
        <h1>Oath of Devotion</h1><br>
        The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest
ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Som etim es called
cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these
paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor,
        acting with honor in pursuit o f justice and the greater
good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of
conduct, and som e, for better or w orse, hold the rest of
the world to the sam e standards. Many who swear this
oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their
gods’ tenets as the m easure o f their devotion. They hold
angels—the perfect servants o f good—as their ideals,
and incorporate im ages of angelic w ings into their
helmets or coats of arms.<br>
        


                  <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Tenets of Devotion</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Though the exact w ords and strictures of the Oath of
Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.<br>
      <b>Honesty.</b> D on’t lie or cheat. Let your w ord be
your promise.<br>
<b>Courage.</b> Never fear to act, though caution is w ise.<br>
<b>Compassion.</b> Aid others, protect the weak, and
punish those w ho threaten them. Show m ercy to your
foes, but tem per it with wisdom .<br>

  <p>W hen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the
following two Channel Divinity options.
      <b>Sacred Weapon.</b> As an action, you can imbue one
weapon that you are holding with positive energy,
using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add
your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that
weapon (with a minim um bonus of +1). The w eapon also
emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20
feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it
becom es magical for the duration.
You can end this effect on your turn as part of any
other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying
this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.<br>
      <b>Turn the Unholy.</b> As an action, you present your
holy sym bol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and
undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or
undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you
must make a W isdom saving throw. If the creature
fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until
it takes damage.
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move
as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly
move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take
            reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action
or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use
the D odge action.

        <H1>Oath of the Ancients</H1><br>
        The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves
and the rituals of the druids. Som etim es called fey
knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins w ho
swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light
in the cosm ic struggle against darkness because they
love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world,
not necessarily because they believe in principles of
honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their arm or and
clothing with im ages of grow ing things—leaves, antlers,
or flow ers—to reflect their com m itm ent to preserving
life and light in the world.

  <p>The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been
preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath
emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns
of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.<br>
      <b>Kindle the Light.</b> Through your acts of mercy,
kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the
world, beating back despair.<br>
      <b>Shelter the Light.</b> W here there is good, beauty, love,
and laughter in the world, stand against the w ickedness
that w ould sw allow it. W here life flourishes, stand
against the forces that would render it barren.<br>
      <b>P reserve Your Own Light.</b> Delight in song and
laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in
your ow n heart, you can’t preserve it in the world.<br>
      <b>B e the Light.</b> Be a glorious beacon for all w ho live in
despair. Let the light o f your joy and courage shine forth
in all your deeds.

you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach
for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see.
The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity
saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. W hile
restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving
throw at the end o f each of its turns. On a success, it
frees itself and the vines vanish.<br>
      <b>Turn the Faithless.</b> You can use your Channel
Divinity to utter ancient w ords that are painful for fey
and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy
      symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that
can hear you must make a W isdom saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move
as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly

the D odge action.

shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while
it is turned.
