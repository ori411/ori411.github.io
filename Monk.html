            <h1>The Magicof Ki</h1><br>
            M onks make careful study o f a magical energy that most
monastic traditions call ki. This energy is an element
o f the m agic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically,
the element that flows through living bodies. M onks
harness this pow er within themselves to create magical
effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities,
and som e of their special attacks can hinder the flow o f
ki in their opponents. Using this energy, m onks channel
uncanny speed and strength into their unarm ed strikes.
As they gain experience, their martial training and their
mastery o f ki gives them m ore pow er over their bodies
and the bodies of their foes.
<br>
            <h1>Class Features</h1><br>
As a monk, you gain the following class features.<br>
<h3> Hit Points</h3><br>
            <b>Hit Dice:</b> 1d8 per monk level<br>
            <b>Hit Points at 1st Level:</b> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br>
            <b>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</b> 1d8 (or 5) + your
Constitution m odifier per m onk level after 1st<br>
            <b>Proficiencies</b><br>
            <b>Armor:</b> None<br>
            <b>Weapons:</b> Simple w eapons, shortswords<br>

                        <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Unarmored Defensed</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Beginning at 1st level, while you are w earing no armor
and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your
Dexterity m odifier + your W isdom modifier.

    </p>
</div>
                        <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Martial Arts</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you
mastery of com bat styles that use unarm ed strikes and
m onk w eapons, which are shortsw ords and any simple
melee w eapons that don’t have the two-handed or
heavy property.
You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed
or wielding only m onk w eapons and you aren’t wearing
arm or or wielding a shield:<br>
• You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the
attack and damage rolls o f your unarm ed strikes and
m onk weapons.<br>
• You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage
o f your unarm ed strike or m onk weapon. This die
changes as you gain m onk levels, 1d6 at lv5, 1d8 at lv11, 1d10 at lv17.<br>
• W hen you use the Attack action with an unarmed
strike or a m onk w eapon on your turn, you can make
one unarm ed strike as a bonus action. For example, if
you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarm ed strike as a bonus
action, assum ing you haven't already taken a bonus
action this turn.<br>
Certain monasteries use specialized form s of the
m onk weapons. For example, you might use a club
that is two lengths of w ood connected by a short chain
(called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter
blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a
m onk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided
for the weapon
    </p>
</div>
                        <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Ki</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to
harness the mystic energy o f ki. Your access to this
energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your
m onk level determines the number of points you have,
as show n in the Ki Points colum n of the M onk table.
You can spend these points to fuel various ki features.
You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows,
Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn m ore
ki features as you gain levels in this class.
W hen you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until
you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you
draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You
must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to
regain your ki points.
S om e of your ki features require your target to make
a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving
throw DC is calculated as follows:<br>
      <b>Ki save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier
    <h3>Flurry of Blows</h3>
Immediately after you take the Attack action on your
turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make tw o unarm ed
strikes as a bonus action.<br>
    <h3>Patient Defense</h3>
You can spend 1 ki point to take the D odge action as a
bonus action on your turn.<br>
    <h3>Stepof the Wind</h3>
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash
action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump
distance is doubled for the turn.

<div class="content">
  <p>Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet
while you are not w earing arm or or wielding a shield.
This bonus increases when you reach certain monk
levels, as show n in the M onk table.
At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical
surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling
during the move.

  <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to
deflect or catch the missile w hen you are hit by a ranged
weapon attack. W hen you do so, the damage you take
from the attack is reduced by 1d 10 + your Dexterity
modifier + your m onk level.
If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the
missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand
and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a
missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a
ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition
you just caught, as part of the sam e reaction. You make
this attack with proficiency, regardless o f your w eapon
proficiencies, and the missile counts as a m onk weapon
for the attack.

        <h1>Monastic Traditions</h1><br>
        Three traditions of m onastic pursuit are com m on in
the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most
m onasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a
few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk
according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three
traditions rely on the sam e basic techniques, diverging
as the student grow s m ore adept. Thus, a m onk need
choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.<br>
        <h1>Way of the Open Hand</h1><br>
        M onks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate
masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or
unarm ed. They learn techniques to push and trip their
opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their
bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can
protect them from harm.


                        <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Open Hand Technique</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Starting w hen you choose this tradition at 3rd level,
you can manipulate your enem y’s ki w hen you harness
your own. W henever you hit a creature with one of the
attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can im pose
one of the following effects on that target:<br>
• It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be
knocked prone.<br>

</div>
        <h1>Way of Shadow</h1><br>
        M onks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that
values stealth and subterfuge. These m onks might
be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as
spies and assassins. Som etim es the m em bers of a
ninja monastery are family m em bers, form ing a clan
sw orn to secrecy about their arts and m issions. Other
m onasteries are m ore like thieves’ guilds, hiring out
their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else
