            Half-elves have no lands o f their own, though they are
            w elcom e in human cities and som ewhat less w elcom e
            in elven forests. In large cities in regions w here elves
            and humans interact often, half-elves are som etim es
            num erous enough to form small com m unities of their
            own. They enjoy the com pany of other half-elves, the
            only people w ho truly understand what it is to live
            between these two worlds.<br>

            exceeding 180 years.<br>
            <b>Alignment.</b> Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their
            elven heritage. They value both personal freedom and
            creative expression, demonstrating neither love
            of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at
            rules, resent others’ demands, and som etim es prove
            unreliable, or at least unpredictable.<br>

            light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t

            <b>Fey Ancestry.</b> You have advantage on saving throws
