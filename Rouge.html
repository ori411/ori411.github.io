a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their com bat
abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other
characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and
deception, while others refine the skills that help them
in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and
disarm ing traps, and opening locks.<br>
            <h1>Class Features</h1><br>

<b>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</b> 1d8 (or 5) + your
Constitution modifier per rogue level after 1st<br>
            <h3>Proficiencies</h3><br>

<b>Weapons:</b> Simple weapons, hand crossbow s,
longswords, rapiers, shortswords<br>
<b>Tools:</b> Thieves’ tools<br>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Expertise</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or
one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with
thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any
ability check you m ake that uses either of the chosen
proficiencies.
At 6th level, you can choose two m ore of your
proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain
this benefit.

</div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Sneak Attack</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly
and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can
deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with
an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The
attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another
enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy
isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on
the attack roll.
The amount of the extra damage increases as you
gain levels in this class, as show n in the Sneak Attack
colum n of the Rogue table.

<div class="content">
  <p>During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a
secret m ix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to
hide m essages in seem ingly norm al conversation. Only
another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands
such m essages. It takes four tim es longer to convey such
a m essage than it does to speak the sam e idea plainly.
In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and
sym bols used to convey short, simple m essages, such
as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a
thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether thepeople in an area are easy m arks or will provide a safe
house for thieves on the run.

in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin,

<div class="content">
  <p>Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out o f the
way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery
breath or an ice storm spell. W hen you are subjected

throw to take only half damage, you instead take no
damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only

<div class="content">
  <p>By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until

incapacitated.

  <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Stroke of Luck</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding
w hen you need to. If your attack m isses a target within

            <h1>Roguish Archetypes</h1><br>
            R ogues have many features in com m on, including their
emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and
deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick
reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in
varying directions, em bodied by the rogue archetypes.
Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—
not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession,
but a description of your preferred techniques.<br>
            <h1>Thief</h1><br>
            You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars,
bandits, cutpurses, and other crim inals typically follow
this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of
themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers,
delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your
agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into
ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using
m agic items you normally couldn’t employ.<br>



  <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Fast Hands</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action
granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity
(Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to
disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an
Object action

    </p>
</div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Second-Story Work</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>W hen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain
the ability to climb faster than normal; clim bing no
longer costs you extra movement.
In addition, when you make a running jump, the
distance you cover increases by a num ber of feet equal
to your Dexterity modifier.

    </p>
</div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Supreme Sneak</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity
(Stealth) check if you move no m ore than half your
speed on the same turn.


    </p>
</div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Use Magic Device</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>By 13th level, you have learned enough about the
workings of m agic that you can im provise the use of
items even when they are not intended for you. You
ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use
of m agic items.


    </p>
</div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Thief’s Reflexes</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>W hen you reach 17th level, you have becom e adept at
laying am bushes and quickly escaping danger. You can
take two turns during the first round of any combat. You
take your first turn at your norm al initiative and yoursecond turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use
this feature when you are surprised.
    </p>
</div>
            <h1>Assassin</h1><br>
            You focus your training on the grim art of death. Those
w ho adhere to this archetype are diverse: hired killers,
spies, bounty hunters, and even specially anointed
priests trained to exterminate the enem ies of their deity.
Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your
foes with deadly efficiency.


  <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Bonus Proficiencies</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>W hen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain
proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner’s kit

    </p>
</div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Assassinate</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>A s s a s s i n a t e
Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest w hen you
get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on
attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn
in the com bat yet. In addition, any hit you score against
a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.


    </p>
</div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Infiltration Expertise</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Starting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false
identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and
25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations
for an identity. You can’t establish an identity that
belongs to som eone else. For example, you might acquire
appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and officiallooking certification to establish yourself as a mem ber of
a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate
yourself into the com pany of other wealthy merchants.
Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise,
other creatures believe you to be that person until given
an obvious reason not to.

listening to speech, exam ining handwriting, and
observing mannerisms.
Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a
wary creature suspects som ething is am iss, you have
advantage on any Charisma (D eception) check you make
to avoid detection.

    </p>
</div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Death Strike</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Starting at 17th level, you becom e a master of instant
death. W hen you attack and hit a creature that is
surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw

bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your
attack against the creature.
