            <h1>Sworn and Beholden</h1><br>
            A w arlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly
being. Som etim es the relationship between w arlock
and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though
the beings that serve as patrons for w arlocks are not
gods. A w arlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon
prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings
not typically served by clerics. M ore often, though, the
arrangement is similar to that between a master and
an apprentice. The w arlock learns and grow s in power,
at the cost o f occasional services perform ed on the
patron’s behalf.<br>
            <h1>Class Features</h1><br>

<div class="content">
  <p>At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an
otherworldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the
Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of which is detailed
at the end of the class description. Your choice
grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th,
and 14th level.

<div class="content">
  <p>
      Your arcane research and the m agic bestow ed on you
by your patron have given you facility with spells. See
chapter 10 for the general rules o f spellcasting and
chapter 11 for the w arlock spell list.<BR>
<h3>Cantrips</h3><br>
You know two cantrips of your choice from the w arlock
spell list. You learn additional w arlock cantrips of your
choice at higher levels, as show n in the Cantrips Known
colum n of the W arlock table.<br>
<h3>SpellSlots</h3><br>
The W arlock table shows how many spell slots you have.
The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all
o f your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your
w arlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a
spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a short or long rest.
For example, when you are 5th level, you have
tw o 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell
thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and
you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.<br>
<h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3><br>
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice
from the w arlock spell list.
The Spells Known colum n of the W arlock table shows
when you learn m ore w arlock spells of your choice of 1st
level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level
no higher than what’s show n in the table's Slot Level
colum n for your level. W hen you reach 6th level, for
example, you learn a new w arlock spell, which can be
1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.
      Additionally, when you gain a level in this class,
you can choose one of the w arlock spells you know
and replace it with another spell from the warlock
spell list, which also must be of a level for w hich you
have spell slots.<br>
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><br>
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your w arlock
spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers
to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
Charisma modifier w hen setting the saving throw DC
for a w arlock spell you cast and w hen making an attack
roll with one.<br>
      <b>Spell save DC </b>= 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier<br>
    <b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier<br>
<h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3><br>
You can use an arcane focus as a
spellcasting focus for your w arlock spells.

<div class="content">
  <p>In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch
invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that
imbue you with an abiding magical ability.
At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your
choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end
of the class description. W hen you gain certain w arlock
levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice,
as show n in the Invocations Known colum n of the
W arlock table.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class,
you can choose one of the invocations you know and
replace it with another invocation that you could learn
at that level.

<div class="content">
  <p>At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestow s a gift
upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the
following features of your choice.<br>
    <h3>Pact of the Chain</h3><br>
You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a
ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of
spells known.
W hen you cast the spell, you can choose one of the
norm al form s for your familiar or one of the following
special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.
Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can
forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to
make one attack o f its own.<br>
    <h3>Pactof the Blade</h3><br>
You can use your action to create a pact w eapon in your
empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee
w eapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 for
w eapon options). You are proficient with it while you
w ield it. This w eapon counts as m agical for the purpose
o f overcom ing resistance and immunity to nonm agical
attacks and damage.
      Your pact w eapon disappears if it is m ore than 5 feet
away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears
if you use this feature again, if you dism iss the w eapon
(no action required), or if you die.
You can transform one m agic w eapon into your pact
weapon by perform ing a special ritual while you hold
the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course
of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.
You can then dism iss the weapon, shunting it into an
extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you
create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an
artifact or a sentient w eapon in this way. The weapon
ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform
the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use
a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon
appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space
when the bond breaks.<br>
    <h3>Pact of the Tome</h3><br>
Your patron gives you a grim oire called a B ook of
Shadows. W hen you gain this feature, choose three
cantrips from any class’s spell list. W hile the book is on
your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They
don’t count against your number of cantrips known.
If you lose your B ook o f Shadows, you can perform
a 1-hour cerem ony to receive a replacement from your
patron. This cerem ony can be perform ed during a short
or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book
turns to ash when you die.

choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability

        <h1>Otherworldly Patrons</h1><br>
        The beings that serve as patrons for w arlocks are
mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not
gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons
give their w arlocks access to different pow ers and
invocations, and expect significant favors in return.
Som e patrons collect w arlocks, doling out mystic
knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability
to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their
pow er only grudgingly, and might make a pact with
only one warlock. W arlocks w ho serve the same patron
might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.<br>
        <h1>The Archfey</h1><br>
        Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of
legend w ho holds secrets that w ere forgotten before
the mortal races w ere born. This being’s motivations
are often inscrutable, and som etim es whimsical, and
might involve a striving for greater magical pow er or the
settling of age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include
the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness,
ruler of the Gloam ing Court; Titania of the Sum m er
Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam,
the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.
