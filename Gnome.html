            <h1>Delighted Dedication</h1><br>
            As far as gnom es are concerned, being alive is a
            wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of
            enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life.
            Humans might w onder about getting bored over the
            course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time
            to savor the beauties of the world in their long years, but
            gnom es seem to w orry that even with all that time, they
            can’t get in enough of the things they want to do and see.
            Gnom es speak as if they can’t get the thoughts
            out of their heads fast enough. Even as they offer
            ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, they still
            manage to listen carefully to others, adding the
            appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation
            along the way.<br>
            <hr>
            <h1>Gnome Traits</h1><br>

            around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500 years.<br>
            <b>Alignment.</b> Gnom es are most often good. Those who
            tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers,
            scholars, investigators, or inventors. T hose w ho tend
            toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters, wanderers,
            or fanciful jew elers. G nom es are good-hearted, and

            <hr>
            <h1>Forest Gnome</h1><br>
            As a forest gnome, you have a natural knack for illusion
            and inherent quickness and stealth. In the worlds of
            DND, forest gnomes are rare and secretive. They gather
            in hidden com m unities in sylvan forests, using illusions
            and trickery to conceal themselves from threats or
            to m ask their escape should they be detected. Forest
            gnom es tend to be friendly with other good-spirited
            w oodland folk, and they regard elves and good fey as
            their most important allies. These gnom es also befriend
            small forest animals and rely on them for information
            about threats that might prowl their lands.<br>
            <b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Dexterity score
            increases by 1.<br>
            <b>Natural Illusionist.</b> You know the minor illusion
            cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.<br>
            <b>Speak with Small Beasts.</b> Through sounds and
            gestures, you can comm unicate simple ideas with Small
            or smaller beasts. Forest gnomes love animals and often
            keep squirrels, badgers, rabbits, moles, woodpeckers,
            and other creatures as beloved pets.<br>
            <h1>Rock Gnome</h1><br>
            As a rock gnom e, you have a natural inventiveness and
            hardiness beyond that of other gnom es. M ost gnom es
            in the worlds of DND are rock gnom es, including the
            tinker gnom es of the Dragonlance setting.<br>
            <b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Constitution score
            increases by 1.<br>
            <b>Artificer’s Lore.</b> W henever you make an Intelligence
            (History) check related to m agic items, alchemical
            objects, or technological devices, you can add tw ice your
            proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you
            normally apply.<br>
            <b>Tinker.</b> You have proficiency with artisan’s tools
            (tinker’s tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1
            hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny
            clockw ork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases
            to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour
            repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when
            you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can
            reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up
            to three such devices active at a time.
            W hen you create a device, choose one of the
            following options:<br>
            <i>Clockwork Toy.</i> This toy is a clockw ork animal, monster,
            or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or
            soldier. W hen placed on the ground, the toy m oves
            5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a
            random direction. It makes noises as appropriate
            to the creature it represents.<br>
            <i>Fire Starter.</i> The device produces a miniature
            flame, which you can use to light a candle,
            torch, or campfire. Using the device
            requires your action.<br>
            <i>Music Box.</i> W hen opened, this music box
            plays a single song at a moderate volume.
            The box stops playing when it
            reaches the song’s end or
            when it is closed.<br>
