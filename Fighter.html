maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you

            The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.
Commander’s Strike. W hen you take the Attack
action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks
and use a bonus action to direct one of your com panions
to strike. W hen you do so, choose a friendly creature
w ho can see or hear you and expend one superiority die.
That creature can immediately use its reaction to make
one w eapon attack, adding the superiority die to the
attack’s damage roll.
Disarming Attack. W hen you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to
attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item
o f your choice that it’s holding. You add the superiority
die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must
make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops
the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.
Distracting Strike. W hen you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to
distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You
add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll. The
next attack roll against the target by an attacker other
than you has advantage if the attack is made before the
start of your next turn.
Evasive Footwork. W hen you move, you can expend
one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the
number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.
Feinting Attack. You can expend one superiority die
and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing
one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You
have advantage on your next attack roll against that
creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the
attack’s damage roll.
Goading Attack. W hen you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to
attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add
the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and
the target must make a W isdom saving throw. On a
failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack
rolls against targets other than you until the end of
your next turn.
Lunging Attack. W hen you make a melee w eapon
attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die
to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit,
you add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.
