                        <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Spellcasting</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or
ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with
arcane m agic. This font of magic, whatever its origin,
fuels your spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list.<br>
<h3>Cantrips</h3><br>
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from
the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer
cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as show n in the
Cantrips Known colum n of the Sorcerer table.<br>
    <h3>S p e l l S l o t s</h3><br>
The Sorcerer table show s how many spell slots you
have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast
one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of
the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell
slots w hen you finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning
hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot
available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.
S pells K n o w n o f 1s t L e v e l a n d H ig h e r
You know two 1st-level spells o f your choice from the
sorcerer spell list.
The Spells K now n colum n of the Sorcerer table
show s when you learn more sorcerer spells of your
choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which
you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd
level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st
or 2nd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class,
you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know
and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer
spell list, which also must be of a level for w hich you
have spell slots.<br>
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><br>
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer
spells, since the pow er of your m agic relies on your
ability to project your w ill into the world. You use your
Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier
when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell
you cast and w hen making an attack roll with one.<br>
<b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier<br>
<b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier<br>
    <h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3><br>
    You can use an arcane focus as a
spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.

    <h1>Sorcerous Origins</h1><br>
    Different sorcerers claim different origins for their
innate magic. Although many variations exist, most
of these origins fall into two categories: a draconic
bloodline and wild magic.<br>
    <h1>Draconic Bloodline</h1><br>
    Your innate m agic com es from draconic m agic that was
mingled with your blood or that o f your ancestors. M ost
often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent
back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times w ho made a
bargain with a dragon or who might even have claim ed
a dragon parent. S om e of these bloodlines are well
established in the world, but m ost are obscure. Any
given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a
result of a pact or som e other exceptional circum stance.

                         <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Dragon Ancestor</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your
ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon
is used by features you gain later.<br>
      <pre>
Dragon  Damage Type
Black   Acid
Blue    Lightning
Brass   Fire
Bronze  Lightning
Copper  Acid
Cold    Fire
Green   Poison
Red     Fire
Silver  Cold
White   Cold
</pre><br>
    You can speak, read, and write D raconic. Additionally,
whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting
with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it
applies to the check.


    </p>
</div>
                         <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Draconic Resilience</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>As m agic flows through your body, it causes physical
traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level,
your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by
1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.
Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin
sheen of dragon-like scales. W hen you aren’t wearing
armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

    </p>
</div>
                         <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>ElementalAffinity</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals
damage of the type associated with your draconic
ancestry, add your Charisma modifier to that damage.
At the sam e time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain
resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.

</div>
                         <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Dragon Wings</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of
dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed
equal to your current speed. You can create these w ings
as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you
dism iss them as a bonus action on your turn.
You can’t manifest your w ings while w earing armor
unless the arm or is made to accom m odate them, and
clothing not made to accom m odate your w ings might
be destroyed when you manifest them.


    </p>
</div>
                         <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Draconic Presence</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread
presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around
you to becom e awestruck or frightened. As an action,
you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power
and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a
distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your
concentration (as if you w ere casting a concentration
spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this
aura must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or be
charm ed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose
fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on
this saving throw is im mune to your aura for 24 hours.

    </p>
</div>
<h1>WildMagic</h1><br>
Your innate m agic com es from the wild forces of chaos
that underlie the order of creation. You might have
endured exposure to som e form o f raw magic, perhaps
through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental
Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you
were blessed by a pow erful fey creature or marked by a
demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with
no apparent cause or reason. However it cam e to be, this
chaotic m agic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.

                         <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>WildMagic Surge</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Starting w hen you choose this origin at 1st level, your
spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic.
Immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level
or higher, the DM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a
1, roll on the W ild Magic Surge table to create a random
magical effect.

using your w ild magic. W hen another creature you can
see m akes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving
throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery
points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a
bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature’s roll. Youcan do so after the creature rolls but before any effects
of the roll occur.
