        <main><img src="Elf.png"><h1>A Timeless Perspective</h1><br>
            Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad
            perspective on events that might trouble the shorterlived races m ore deeply. They are m ore often amused
            than excited, and m ore likely to be curious than
            greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty
            happenstance. W hen pursuing a goal, however, whether
            adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art,
            elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to
            make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget
            them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to
            serious insults with vengeance.

            <h1>Elf Traits</h1><br>
            Your elf character has a variety o f natural abilities, the
            result o f thousands o f years of elven refinement.<br>
            <b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Dexterity score
            increases by 2.<br>
            <b>Age.</b> Although elves reach physical maturity at about
            the sam e age as humans, the elven understanding of
            adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encom pass
            worldly experience. An elf typically claim s adulthood
            and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live
            to be 750 years old.<br>
            <b>Alignment.</b> Elves love freedom , variety, and selfexpression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler
            aspects of chaos. They value and protect others'
            freedom as well as their own, and they are more
            often good than not. The drow are an exception; their
            exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and
            dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.<br>
            <b>Size.</b> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and
            have slender builds. Your size is Medium.<br>
            <b>Speed.</b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br>
            <b>Darkvision.</b> Accustom ed to twilit forests and the night
            sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.
            You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it
            w ere bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.
            You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
            <b>Keen Senses.</b> You have proficiency in the
            Perception skill.<br>
            <b>Fey Ancestry.</b> You have advantage on saving throws
            against being charm ed, and m agic can’t put you to sleep.<br>
            <b>Trance.</b> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they
            meditate deeply, remaining sem iconscious, for 4
            hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation
            is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a
            fashion; such dream s are actually mental exercises that
            have becom e reflexive through years of practice. After
            resting in this way, you gain the sam e benefit that a
            human does from 8 hours of sleep.<br>
            <b>Languages.</b> You can speak, read, and write Com m on
            and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and
            intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied,
            and their songs and poems are fam ous am ong other
            races. Many bards learn their language so they can add
            Elvish ballads to their repertoires.<br>
            <b>Subrace.</b> Ancient divides am ong the elven people
            resulted in three main subraces: high elves, w ood elves,
            and dark elves, w ho are com m only called drow. Choose
            one of these subraces. In som e worlds, these subraces
            are divided still further (such as the sun elves and m oon
            elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can
            choose a narrower subrace.
            <hr>
            <H1>High Elf</H1><br>
            As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of
            at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds
            of DND, there are two kinds of high elves. One type
            (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of
            Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the
            sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and
            reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to
            non-elves and even other elves. The other type
            (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the
            Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the m oon elves
            of the Forgotten Realms) are m ore com m on
            and m ore friendly, and often encountered
            am ong humans and other races.
            The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold
            elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and
            hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their
            eyes are golden, silver, or black. M oon elves (also
            called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler,
            with alabaster skin som etim es tinged with blue.
            They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue,
            but various shades of blond, brown, and red are
            not uncom m on. Their eyes are blue or green and
            flecked with gold.<br>
            <b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Intelligence score
            increases by 1.<br>
            <b>Elf Weapon Training.</b> You have proficiency with
            the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.<br>
            <b>Cantrip.</b> You know one cantrip of your choice from
            the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting
            ability for it.<br>
            <b>Extra Language.</b> You can speak, read, and write one
            extra language of your choice.<br>
            <h1>Wood Elf</h1><br>
            As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and
            your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through
            your native forests. This category includes the wild
            elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of
            Dragonlance, as well as the races called w ood elves in
            Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerun, w ood
            elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves)
            are reclusive and distrusting o f non-elves.
            W ood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue,
            som etim es with traces of green. Their hair tends toward
            brow ns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or
            copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.<br>

            increases by 1.<br>
            <b>Elf Weapon Training.</b> You have proficiency with the
            longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.<br>
            <b>Fleet of Foot.</b> Your base walking speed
            increases to 35 feet.<br>
            <b>Mask of the Wild.</b> You can attempt to hide even when
            you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain,
            falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.<br>
            <h1>Dark Elf (Drow)</h1><br>
            Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned
            elves, the drow were banished from the surface world
            for following the goddess Lolth down the path to
            evil and corruption. N ow they have built their own
            civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned
            after the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow
            have black skin that resem bles polished obsidian and
            stark white or pale yellow hair. They com m only have
            very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in
            shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to
            be smaller and thinner than m ost elves.
            Drow adventurers are rare, and the race does not exist
            in all worlds. Check with your Dungeon Master to see
            if you can play a drow character.<br>
            <b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Charisma score
            increases by 1.<br>
            <b>Superior Darkvision.</b> Your darkvision has a

            sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever
            you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.<br>
            <b>Drow Magic.</b> You know the dancing lights cantrip.

            spell once per day. W hen you reach 5th level, you can

            rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbows.<br>
