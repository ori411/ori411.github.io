            <div id="right"><h1>Long Memory, Long Grudges</h1><br>
            Dwarves can live to be m ore than 400 years old, so the
             oldest living dwarves often rem em ber a very different
             world. For example, som e of the oldest dwarves living
             in Citadel Felbarr (in the w orld of the Forgotten Realms)
             can recall the day, m ore than three centuries ago, when
             orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile
             that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a
             perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as
             humans and halflings lack

            <h1>Dwarf Traits</h1><br>
            Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn
            abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.<br>
            <b>Ability Score Increase</b>. Your Constitution score
            increases by 2.<br>
            <b>Age.</b> Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but
            they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50.
            On average, they live about 350 years.<br>
            <b>Alignment.</b> Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly
            in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend
            toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and
            a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of
            a just order.<br>
            <b>Size.</b> Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and
            average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.<br>
            <b>Speed.</b> Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your
            speed is not reduced by w earing heavy armor.<br>
            <b>Darkvision.</b> A customed to life underground, you
            have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You
            can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were
            bright light, and in darkness as if it w ere dim light. You
            can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
            <b>Dwarven Resilience.</b> You have advantage on saving
            throws against poison, and you have resistance against
            poison damage.<br>
            <b>Dwarven Combat Training.</b> You have proficiency
            with the battleaxe, handaxe, throwing hammer,
            and warhammer.
            <b>Tool Proficiency.</b> You gain proficiency with the
            artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brew er’s
            supplies, or m ason’s tools.<br>
            <b>Stonecunning.</b> W henever you make an Intelligence
            (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you
            are considered proficient in the History skill and add
            double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of
            your norm al proficiency bonus.<br>
            <b>Languages.</b> You can speak, read, and write Common
            and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and
            guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into
            whatever other language a dwarf might speak.<br>
            Subrace. Two main subraces o f dwarves populate the
            worlds of DND: hill dwarves and mountain dwarves.
            Choose one of these subraces.
            <hr>
            <h1>Hill Dwarf</h1><br>
            As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition,
            and remarkable resilience. The gold dwarves of Faerun
            in their mighty southern kingdom are hill dwarves, as
            are the exiled Neidar and the debased Klar of Krynn in
            the Dragonlance setting.<br>
            <b>Ability</b> Score Increase. Your W isdom score
            increases by 1.<br>
            <b>Dwarven</b> Toughness. Your hit point maximum
            increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you
            gain a level.<br>
            <h1>Mountain Dwarf</h1><br>
            As a mountain dwarf, you're strong and hardy,
            accustom ed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. You’re
            probably on the tall side (for a dwarf), and tend toward
            lighter coloration. The shield dwarves of northern
            Faerun, as well as the ruling Hylar clan and the noble
            Daewar clan of Dragonlance, are mountain dwarves.<br>
            <b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Strength score
            increases by 2.<br>
            <b>Dwarven Armor Training.</b> You have proficiency with
            light and medium armor.
